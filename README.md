# TinyApp Project

Create, share and manage your links with TinyApp!

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

- This app enables users to shorten links to fit more non-URL text on platforms like Twitter, with character limitations rules in place.
- To start using TinyApp, a user must complete the registration form; or log in with an existing account.
- User passwords are hashed with bcrypt for security purposes.

Happy URL-shortening!
